# ROS Sample
This is a ROS-sample project that runs with Docker. It starts two nodes:
* A web interface that contains two buttons
* A node that prints the state of a wheel (as a position between 0 and 80) to the command line

## Requirements
* Docker

## Getting started
* Run `docker compose up`
* The interface should be available on `localhost:8080`!
